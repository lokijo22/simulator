# Simulator

Simulator(placeholder name till i come up with a better one) is a particle simulation engine written in Go.

This project is currently being rebuilt from the ground up with a focus on performance, scalability, and clean architecture. A previous version of this engine was implemented in Python, but is being rewritten in Go to achieve better performance and more efficient resource usage.

## Project Goals

* Provide a performant core for particle-based simulations
* Support scalable simulation of large numbers of particles
* Serve as a foundation for experimentation, visualization, and future extensions

## Project Status

This project is under active development. Core systems are being redesigned and implemented incrementally.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lokijo22/simulator.git
cd simulator
```

Build the project:

```bash
go build ./...
```

Run the project:

```bash
go run main.go
```
